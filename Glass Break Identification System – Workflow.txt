Glass Break Identification System – Workflow

1. Audio Signal Acquisition (Input Stage)

MAX2244 Audio Sensor captures sound waves.
Converts analog sound signals to digital using STM32’s ADC.

2. Preprocessing & Feature Extraction

Filters noise and extracts key features from the audio.
Converts time-domain data into frequency-domain features.

3. Machine Learning Classification (NanoEdge AI)

The ZVM model (NanoEdge AI) classifies sounds into:
Shattering (Complete glass break)
Breaking (Partial break or cracks forming)
Cracking (Small stress fractures)
Runs directly on the STM32 microcontroller.

4. Output & Alerts

STM32 Console displays the identified sound type.
Can trigger an alarm or notification for security systems.

This system enables real-time glass break detection with low power consumption.
